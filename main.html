	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>
        Time complexity is a crucial concept in computer science that measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. Efficient algorithms are those with low time complexity, meaning they can handle larger inputs without a significant increase in execution time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires in relation to the input size. In algorithm analysis, we often express space complexity using Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. One common notation is <b>Space Complexity</b>, which helps us understand how the memory requirements of an algorithm scale with the input size.
